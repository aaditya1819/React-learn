# ⚛️ React Learning Journey

Welcome to my React learning repository! This project serves as a comprehensive log of my journey into the world of React, where I explore everything from foundational concepts to advanced patterns.

## 🚀 Projects & Milestones

This repository is organized into different modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of React development.

| Folder | Description | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[01vitereact](./01vitereact)** | Initial setup using Vite. Covers components, props, and basic hooks. | Vite, React, CSS |
| **[custom_react](./custom_react)** | Deep dive into how React works under the hood by building a custom renderer. | JavaScript, HTML |

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/React.git
   cd React
   ```

2. **Navigate to a specific project (e.g., 01vitereact):**
   ```bash

## 📚 What I'm Learning

- [x] Setting up React with Vite
- [x] Understanding JSX and Components
- [x] Props and State Management
- [x] Custom React Renderer (Under the hood)
- [ ] Hooks (useEffect, useContext, useReducer, etc.)
- [ ] React Router
- [ ] Context API & Redux Toolkit
- [ ] API Integrations (Fetch/Axios)
- [ ] Tailwind CSS Integration

## ✍️ Notes
- **01vitereact:** This was my first step. Using Vite is much faster than `create-react-app`. I learned how to structure a basic app and use `main.jsx` vs `App.jsx`.
- **custom_react:** This was a mind-blowing exercise where I understood how React translates JSX into DOM elements using a custom `render` function.
