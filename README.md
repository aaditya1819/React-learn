# ⚛️ React Learning Journey

Welcome to my React learning repository! This project serves as a comprehensive log of my journey into the world of React, where I explore everything from foundational concepts to advanced patterns.

## 🚀 Projects & Milestones

This repository is organized into different modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of React development.

| Folder | Description | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[01vitereact](./01vitereact)** | Initial setup using Vite. Covers components, props, and basic hooks. | Vite, React, CSS |
| **[02counter](./02counter)** | Understanding React Hooks by building a simple counter application. | React, Hooks (useState) |
| **[03_tailwing_props](./03_tailwing_props)** | Integrating Tailwind CSS with React and understanding how to use props. | Vite, React, Tailwind CSS |
| **[custom_react](./custom_react)** | Deep dive into how React works under the hood by building a custom renderer. | JavaScript, HTML |
| **[04bgchanger](./04bgchanger)** | A simple background color changer app to practice state and event handling. | Vite, React, Tailwind CSS |
| **[05passwordGenerator](./05passwordGenerator)** | A robust password generator with customizable options (Length, Numbers, Special Characters). | Vite, React, Hooks (useCallback, useEffect, useRef) |
| **[06currency_coverter](./06currency_coverter)** | A real-time currency converter using custom hooks and external API integration. | Vite, React, Tailwind CSS |

## ✍️ Notes
- **01vitereact:** This was my first step. Using Vite is much faster than `create-react-app`. I learned how to structure a basic app and use `main.jsx` vs `App.jsx`.
- **02counter:** In this project, I explored the power of Hooks, specifically `useState`. I learned why we need state management and how React magically updates the UI when state changes.
- **custom_react:** This was a mind-blowing exercise where I understood how React translates JSX into DOM elements using a custom `render` function.
- **03_tailwing_props:** In this project, I learned how to integrate Tailwind CSS into a Vite project and started exploring how to pass props to components for better reusability.
- **04bgchanger:** A fun project where I practiced dynamic styling in React by changing background colors using `useState`.
- **05passwordGenerator:** An advanced drill into React hooks! I used `useCallback` for performance optimization, `useEffect` to trigger generation on dependency changes, and `useRef` for the "Copy to Clipboard" feature.
- **06currency_coverter:** Deep dive into Custom Hooks! I learned how to create reusable hooks like `useCurrencyInfo` to fetch data from an API and manage complex states in a currency conversion tool.
